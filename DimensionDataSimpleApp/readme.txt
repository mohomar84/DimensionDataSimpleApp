Simple command line Java application with database access
Main functionality:
- command line driven (main class:  MainApp)
- based on input switch, do one of the following:
  (1) provide help/usage info
  (2) count the number of servers currently persisted in the database
  (3) list persisted servers
  (4) delete a persisted server (id of server to delete to be passed in as a command line arg)
  (5) edit name of persisted server (takes command line args to identify id of server and new name)

Additional requirements:
- add unit tests
- use maven or ant based build to do compilation, run tests and produce junit report and runnable jar
